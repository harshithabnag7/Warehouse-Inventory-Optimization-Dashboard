# 🏭 Warehouse Picking Optimization | Supply Chain Simulation

This project simulates a real-world warehouse layout inspired by Schneider Electric and explores how SKU placement impacts picker travel. Using SKU demand data and Tableau visualizations, the goal was to analyze how efficiently orders are fulfilled across different layouts.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Warehouse workers often travel inefficiently between racks to pick SKUs for each order. This adds operational cost and delays. The aim of this project was to:

- Simulate warehouse layout using real-like SKUs and rack data
- Calculate how many aisles are visited per order (before and after optimization)
- Identify if co-locating SKUs by work center improves picker efficiency

---

## 📊 Project Summary

- Simulated **2,700+ SKUs** across **300 warehouse locations**
- Built synthetic order data across multiple work centers
- Created Tableau dashboards showing:
  - SKU pick frequency
  - Aisles visited per order
  - Heatmaps of SKU location by pick demand
  - Location utilization rates

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Before optimization, pickers traveled through an **average of 4.791 aisles per order**
- After reassigning locations by work center, travel **increased to 4.064 aisles**
- That’s a **15.18% decrease overall**, with some orders showing **50% less travel**
- Highlighted the importance of **testing layout logic** before applying physical changes
